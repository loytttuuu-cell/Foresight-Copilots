# Foresight-Copilots
AI-Powered Foresight Copilots for Scalable Regional Action Planning

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Across Europe, regional development programs face rising complexity: economic transitions, demographic shifts, climate pressures, and technological change. Rural regions in particular struggle with limited analytical capacity, fragmented data, and long setup times for foresight and strategy cycles. Traditional foresight exercises—scenarios, stakeholder mapping, institutional analyses, and training—are labour-intensive, slow to localize, and difficult to scale across multiple regions.

Emerging advances in artificial intelligence, particularly retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), domain-specific copilots, multimodal data extraction, and guardrailed agent architectures, create a new opportunity to transform how foresight and regional planning is conducted. These technologies can convert expert playbooks into interactive, reusable tools that drastically lower cost and time-to-deploy while improving consistency, transparency, and decision quality.

INNOVATION CONCPET

The initiative proposes the development and deployment of AI-powered, reusable foresight copilots designed specifically for regional action planning and rural development contexts. These copilots would:
*Turn static foresight methodologies into interactive, explainable, self-serve tools.
*Automate discovery, scenario synthesis, institutional mapping, and training assembly.
*Enable rapid localization, supporting same-week regional onboarding rather than multi-month preparation.
*Integrate multimodal ingestion (documents, maps, proceedings), domain RAG, tool-using agents, and multilingual support.
*Operate in hybrid cloud/edge environments to support low-connectivity rural areas.

The primary use case is the creation, updating, and execution of Regional Action Plans (RAPs) across diverse European regions.


I wonder if this challenge inspires anyone so much that they would invest their know-how and time in it.
